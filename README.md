# Project Overview: Cancer Genomics Binary Outcome Prediction
This project focuses on predicting binary outcomes in cancer genomics data using various machine learning classifiers. The dataset used contains features derived from genomics data, which have been cleaned, analyzed, and utilized to build robust models for classification. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the workflow and methods used in the project.

## 1. Data Loading and Exploration
We begin by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. The data is inspected for missing values and class distribution.

    *Missing Values:* A check is performed to ensure the dataset has no missing values.
    *Class Distribution:* A bar plot of class counts is generated to visually inspect the balance of the dataset.
